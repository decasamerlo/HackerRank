Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.

**Note:** This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to 10<sup>-4</sup> are acceptable.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, n, the size of the array.
The second line contains n space-separated integers that describe arr[n].

## Output Format

Print the following 3 lines, each to 6 decimals:

proportion of positive values
proportion of negative values
proportion of zeros
